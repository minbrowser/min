* remove make server
* remove .DS_Store
* remove folder perf
* fix issue [#8](https://github.com/weixsong/elasticlunr.js/issues/8), do tokenizenation even if the parameter of tokenizer is array type, because if we do not do segmentation, the whole array item will be used to build index then partial query will not be searchable.
* but currently exist cross query error, need to fix.

## 0.8.6

* update README
* remove queryNorm compute, it make the score computation complex and useless.[Elasticsearch queryNorm](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/practical-scoring-function.html#query-norm)

## 0.8.1

* republish

## 0.8.0

* fix issue [example is broken](https://github.com/weixsong/elasticlunr.js/issues/4).

## 0.7.9

** fix fieldSearchStats issue, ["Token Expandation" causes JavaScript error ](https://github.com/weixsong/elasticlunr.js/issues/3), actually fieldSearchStats() should only be called for original token, not for expanded token.
** when doing coordNorm() computation, docId in scores maybe not in docTokens, because docTokens only record original token, expanded token is not recorded. So in coordNorm() we need to check if docId is in docTokens.

## 0.7.8

* update example code

## 0.7.7

* update Makefile

## 0.7.6

* fix fieldSearchStats issue, ["Token Expandation" causes JavaScript error ](https://github.com/weixsong/elasticlunr.js/issues/3)

* add token expand configuration.
* add token expand for search function, the expanded token's weight is penalized.
* add test case for configuration.js for token expand config.

## 0.6.7

* 2. Support query-time boosting, no need to do index-time boosting.
* 3. Change scoring mechanism as the same as Elasticsearch.
* 4. Support boolean model.
* 5. Combined Boolean Model, TF/IDF Model and the Vector Space Model, make the results ranking more reliable.

* 7. Store original JSON documents, not pipeline processed document.

## git clone --bare

I want to add some other features to this lunr.js, and because if I forked the repo and then work on the forked repo, there will be some issues, so I'd to break the connection of my fork with original repo.
The original repo is a great package and give good performance, based on this cornerstone, I could add some other features.
